Pomodoro Timer is a simple and intuitive Android app that helps users to be more productive and efficient by following the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros".
The app not only features a Pomodoro Timer, but also includes a built-in calendar and activities/personalization tab. This allows users to track their progress over time and customize the app to fit their unique needs.
